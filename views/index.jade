      This is my own augmented version of [Learn X In Y Minutes][learn]. I created
      this as a place to store notes and anything I wanted to record about a specific
      language that didn't seem applicable enough to warrant a pull request on the
      original project.

        each lang in featured
          li
            a(href='/#{lang}', class='#{lang}')
              span.icon: i(class='#{langMap[lang]}')
              = lang
